## 🚀 Solve 10 JavaScript Questions Daily – Easy to Hard
Welcome to my personal challenge! In this repository, I’ve taken up the goal of solving 10 JavaScript questions every day, ranging from easy to hard. 🧠💪

## 👨‍💻 Why I Started This Repo
I'm a beginner programmer and I created this repository to improve my logic-building skills and become more confident in problem solving using JavaScript. 💥

## 📌 About the Questions
Questions are sourced from YouTube tutorials, LeetCode, freeCodeCamp, and other platforms.

All questions are included directly in the code files as comments above the solutions.

## 💡 How to Run the Code
All code is written in JavaScript (.js files).
To run the solutions, use Node.js – a JavaScript runtime environment.

To run the code, use the `node filename.js` command.
// example:
// This is a sample JavaScript code
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet("Nitesh"));
